# osTicket: Ticket Lifecycle Examples

This project demonstrates the different stages and actions of a ticket's lifecycle in osTicket, an open-source support ticket system. The examples highlight how tickets progress from submission to resolution, including various custom workflows and automation options.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding the osTicket ticket lifecycle, showing real-world examples of how tickets can be managed and automated at each stage.

### Key Features:
- Detailed ticket lifecycle stages
- Examples of ticket statuses, actions, and automation
- Step-by-step guides for customization
## Ticket Lifecycle Stages

1. **New Ticket**: 
   - Action: A ticket is created by a customer via email or web form.
   - Example: A customer reports a login issue, and osTicket assigns the status "New" to the ticket.

2. **Open/Assigned**:
   - Action: An agent assigns the ticket to themselves or another team member.
   - Example: An agent opens the ticket and marks it "Assigned."

3. **Waiting for Customer**:
   - Action: The agent requests additional information from the customer.
   - Example: The agent asks the customer for more details, and the ticket is set to "Waiting for Customer."

4. **Resolved**:
   - Action: The issue is fixed, and the ticket is marked as "Resolved."
   - Example: An agent resolves the issue and marks the ticket as "Resolved."

5. **Closed**:
   - Action: The ticket is closed after a successful resolution or after a period of inactivity.
   - Example: After 7 days, the ticket is closed automatically using osTicket’s automation feature.
   - ## Automation Examples

osTicket offers several automation features to streamline the ticket lifecycle. These include triggers, email piping, and SLAs.

1. **Auto-Assign New Tickets**: A trigger can automatically assign new tickets to a specific agent or department based on the subject or ticket type.
   - Example: A trigger that automatically assigns tickets with "Password Reset" in the subject to the "Support" department.

2. **SLA Notifications**: SLA rules can automatically send notifications to agents when a ticket is about to breach the SLA.
   - Example: Set a SLA rule to notify agents if a ticket isn't updated within 24 hours.
## Customization and Best Practices

osTicket allows you to fully customize the ticket lifecycle through its admin panel. Here are some best practices to ensure tickets are managed effectively:

1. **Custom Ticket Statuses**:
   - Example: Add a custom status like "Escalated" for issues that need to be handled by senior agents.
   
2. **Automate Ticket Resolution**:
   - Example: Set up a trigger that automatically resolves tickets after a customer confirms the solution.

3. **Set Priorities**:
   - Example: Create different priority levels (Low, Medium, High) to categorize and prioritize tickets based on severity.
